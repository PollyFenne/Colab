        <h3>Facts</h3>
        <p>Despite their exalted status and relative lack of natural predators, pandas are still at risk. Severe threats from humans have left just over 1,800 pandas in the wild.</p>
        <p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China.</p>
        <p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
        <p>A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Population</h4><p>1,864 in the wild</p></li>
            <li><h4>Scientific Name</h4><p>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</p></li>
            <li><h4>Height</h4><p>Adults can grow to more than four feet.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Weight</h4><p>220–330 pounds</p></li>
            <li><h4>Habitats</h4><p>Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of southwest China</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The biological diversity of the panda’s habitat is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems, making the giant panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other species where pandas live. In other words, when we protect pandas, we invariably protect other animals that live around them, such as multicolored pheasants, the golden monkey, takin, and crested ibis. Pandas also bring sustainable economic benefits to many local communities through ecotourism.</p>
